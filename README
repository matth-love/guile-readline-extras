---------------------

readline and guile-readline are required for this module.

Extra readline-fun for guile repl.

- Scheme Procedure: readline-config-set!

  Configure readline through Guile! 
  Set readline keybindings/variables/etc. for use in the guile repl.

  Example:

  In your ~/.guile file add:

  (use-modules (ice-9 readline-extras))

  (define my-readline-rc
    '(("set editing-mode emacs")
      ("\\C-xc" "(system \"\")\\C-b\\C-b")
      ("\\C-xp" "()\\C-b")
      ("\\C-xm" "(use-modules ())\\C-b\\C-b")
      ("\\C-xd" "(strftime \\\"%c\\\" (localtime (current-time)))\\r")))

  (readline-config-set! my-readline-rc)

  and the next time you start guile the keybinding C-xc will insert (system "") into the line
  with the cursor between the quotes and C-cp will insert parens and set the cursor between them,
  C-cm will insert (use-modules ()) with the cursor between the parens and C-xd will insert a quick
  date function and run it, displaying the current-time.
